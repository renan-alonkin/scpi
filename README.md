# About this repository

So, I was looking something to do that is totally different from what I'm doing lately 😅, because of that, I decided to give it a go on functional programming. 

To be more precise, I'm going to check Racket (LISP), because Visual Studio Code has some cool extensions for it (it has nothing to do with the fact that I didn't find a way to make mit-scheme work on Manjaro 🙃).

This repo has the intention to store all my exercises and practices from the book [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html), by Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman. 

**IMPORTANT**: The reason that I choose this book is: reddit said it is quite good, and I trust reddit :|
