# About this repository

So, I was looking something to do that is totally different from what I'm doing lately 😅, so I decided to give it a go on functional programming. 

This repo has the intention to store all my exercises and practices from the book [Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs](https://mitpress.mit.edu/sites/default/files/sicp/index.html), by Abelson, Sussman, and Sussman. 

The reason that I choose this book is: reddit said it is quite good, and I trust reddit :|

## Milestones:
- Chapter 1: In progress ⚙️
